This project includes a Blazor Front End and a WebAPI Back End. It displays a list of products. Copilot helped in generating itegration code for the two parts. Copilot was especially helpful in debugging issues with setting up the integration code and setting up the CORS policies to allow the back end and front end to communicate. It was also helpful finding a small error with having the wrong port number in the API call. It also helped with optimizing the code and setting up inMemory Caching for better performance. Copilot also suggested a timeout feature to keep the app more responsive in case of slow data fetching.
